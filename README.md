## About the project

This is an open source project that serves as a free alternative and with more customization options than [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) website.
- [Demo](https://link.uxyorkis.com/)

## Getting started

If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.
[Download the ZIP from this location](https://github.com/johnggli/linktree/archive/master.zip), or run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command to clone the files to your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uxyorkis/Bio_Links
```
- Once the files are on your machine, open the _[Bio_Links](https://github.com/uxyorkis/Bio_Links)_ folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the **Go Live** button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
- Change the profile image and texts in the `index.html` file.
- Change the colors and fonts in the `style.css` file.
- To change the background, go to the `style.css` file on line 17, uncomment the code snippet and change the url to whatever image you want.
